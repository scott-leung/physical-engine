## Git Commit Specific

- Your commits message must follow our [git commit specific](./GIT_COMMIT_SPECIFIC.md).
- We will check your commit message, if it does not conform to the specification, the commit will be automatically refused, make sure you have read the specification above.
- You could use `git cz` with a CLI interface to replace `git commit` command, it will help you to build a proper commit-message, see [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on your branch - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
